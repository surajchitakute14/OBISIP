                    <h3>library</h3>
                    <p>The objective of a college library is to supplement the instructions imparted in the classroom. It aims to function as an independent teaching agency, encouraging and promoting the use of books in the ways beyond those suggested or required by the classroom. The college library functions basically to assist and support the study and teaching in the respective college. It helps to meet the reading requirements of the students as well as the teachers of the college..</p>

                    <h3>classroom</h3>
                    <p>The virtual classroom transcends the boundaries of location, time and space providing a flexible learning environment for all
                        colleges, Universities and corporate organizations benefit from Virtual classrooms because it provides an excellent way for experts to teach a geographically dispersed group of students without hassle.

                    <h3>campus</h3>
                    <p>There are several aspects to this question: Is the campus itself large or small? Are the students socioeconomically diverse or relatively homogeneous? Are people in the surrounding neighborhood diverse or somewhat similar? Is there a big difference between the socioeconomic situation of the students and of the people living around it? What resources are available on and off campus that might add to, or subtract from, the value of your college experience? Will travel or weather be problematic?

                        Covering all of these issues in one essay is not possible but here are a few things to think about: US Colleges are increasingly determined to find students who are as diverse in experience and interests as possible.</p>
